When we arrived at Royston nick they put us in separate cells and interviewed us separately. What was going on soon became clear when they said that a pair of masked raiders had been going up and down the country doing armed robberies with shotguns on small Post Offices.

Bloody hell, I thought. I was scared they were going to stitch us up with some crimes that could easily get us up to 15 years or more inside.

The CID are expert interrogators and are used to dealing with scumbags like we were, and had my story tied up in contradictory knots in no time, it wasn’t looking good.

They also used the well-worn chestnut that my partner in crime was confessing everything in the other room, and that he laid all the blame on me.
