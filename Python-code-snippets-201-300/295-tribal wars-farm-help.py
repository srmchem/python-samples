requirements:
Windows Only.

pip3 install pyperclip

A text file saved in the current dir named farm.txt
containing the co-ords of each village to be farmed
on a seperate line each.

Origin:
Steve Shambles

Instructions:
After preparing your farm.txt file
Open your rally point in the game
run this script
and after each beep, enter troops to send,
paste in co-rds, then click attack.
repeat after each beep.
When you hear a double beep the farms have all been
sent out.

This will speed up non-premium farming a little,
but more importantly it saves you a lot of screen swapping
and copying co-ords to clipboard, it probably saved
me getting repetitive strain injury in my wrist.

I've never asked if this is legal in the game, but
I can't see why it wouldn't be. If they banned this
health saving script I'd quit the game for good.
