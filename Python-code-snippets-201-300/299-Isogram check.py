Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.
An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word")
is a word or phrase without a repeating letter,
however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

    lumberjacks
    background
    downstream
    six-year-old

The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
